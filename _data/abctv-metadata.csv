coll002,bilanggo-ng-pagibig.jpg,Bilanggo ng Pag-ibig,2015,Season 39,"Bilanggo ng Pag-ibig is an adaptation of Genet’s masterpiece Un Captif Amoureux (Prisoner of Love).

The play, then, seeks to understand and portray Genet’s imagination as well as his controversial insights on revolution, betrayal and deceit, homosexuality, violence, and love. Bilanggo ng Pag-ibig, therefore, is a response to Genet's daring claim and provocation: ""The end pursued by revolution is the discovery of beauty."" ","Rody Vera, Jose Estrella","Wilfrido Ma.
